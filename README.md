# Spotify-Sequential-Skip-Prediction

In many music streaming services such as Spotify, personalized music recommendation systems play a prominent role. These recommendation systems allow the user to listen to suggested music based on a particular song, the userâ€™s mood, time, or location. The vast amount of available music and diverse interests exhibited by various users, as well as by the same user during different situations pose considerable challenges to such systems.

The specific goal of the project was to predict whether a listener will skip a certain song using features such as track audio features and user behavior features. By understanding the factors influencing sequencial skip behaviors and predicting them with machine learning models, the system can dynamically adjust and optimize playlists or recommendations to suit individual users' preferences, ultimately improving their overall experience on the platform.
